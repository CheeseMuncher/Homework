## The Challenge
The core data for this challenge is based on pubs around Leeds. The raw data can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1o5JTtFUHcBAjH47z4i_eZrFdyXvSzY_S/view?usp=sharing) and is based around the [Leeds Beer Quest](https://datamillnorth.org/dataset/leeds-beer-quest)
The employer would like to build an application using this data, that presents information about pubs in and around Leeds to their staff so that they can choose an appropriate post-work watering hole based on their location, rating and services offered.

This challenge can be attempted in one of 3 ways, depending on core discipline.
• Front end focussed: Use [the API provided] (https://datamillnorth.org/dataset/leeds-beer-quest) (this wraps the above dataset) to build a front end application to present this dataset in a searchable manner to end users
• Back end focussed: Using the above dataset, build an API that can be used by front end applications.
• Infrastructure focussed: Given a backend and frontend (that we can provide), build infrastructure, tooling and/or automation approaches for deploying & managing this system.

Principal Engineers (and senior engineers looking for extra kudos) should attempt aspects of all three challenges in order to demonstrate breadth of knowledge across the disciplines.
