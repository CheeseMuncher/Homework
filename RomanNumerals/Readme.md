Write code to convert any number between 1 and 2000 to a Roman Numeral, using the standard rules. You can use libraries/packages within reason but your solution must demonstrate the application of the rules logic you have written. Your solution will be assessed on whether it: -

1) solves the problem
2) is well structured
3) has an appropriate level of complexity

Feel free to use tools you are comfortable with, but you must use C# as the main language. When you are done provide access to the solution so that the interview panel may assess it in its entirety.

Instructions:
• cd to Homework/RomanNumerals
• compile: dotnet build RomanNumerals.sln
• run tests: dotnet test RomanNumerals.sln
• demo: e.g. dotnet run --project RomanNumerals/RomanNumerals.csproj - Console will keep requesting input until a valid input is supplied, which is then convert to roman numerals.
